# Chess

This is my personal Chess program project, created following the video tutorials by Software Architecture & Design on YouTube. Coded in Java, with the GUI elements created from the Java AWT and Swing libraries.

The program is completely functional, except for some strange minor exceptions that are thrown upon runtime. All chess features are implemented, such as castling and en passant captures, with the exception that pawns may only be promoted to queens.

The user is given the option of a human vs. human, human vs. computer, or computer vs. computer game. The computer AI was programmed using a simple MiniMax evaluation algorithm.
